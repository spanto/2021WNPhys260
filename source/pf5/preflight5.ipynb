As an example contribution, Joan Feynman \"developed an understanding of the origin of auroras.\"  This is probably one of the coolest things to have studied IMO.  (See [really cool NASA infographic](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/en/) for the general public - something definitely shareable with friends and family not explicitly studying physics).  Auroras are a visually appealing example of charged particles in a magnetic field, which you'll learn more about later."
