    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "In this expression, $\\vec{r}$ is a field point (we use a `np.meshgrid` to sample field points), and the integral runs over all the currents, whose positions are labeled by the vector $\\vec{r}^\\prime$.  Recall, when discretized for numerical calculations, integrals act as sums.\n",
    "\n",
    "The field point $\\vec{r}$ is fixed for a particular integration (sum). In general, this integral is difficult to evaluate analytically. This is why most introductory courses, like Phys260, typically restrict to examples with symmetries, like infinite straight wires, or the axis of symmetry of a loop. Computers have no such limitations, as we can sample over any configuration, regardless of symmetry (recall how we calculated the electric field due to a rectangular prism of charge).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Biot-Savart Law bears a strong mathematical resemblance to Coulomb's Law.  Consequently, we will use a similar numerical approach to integrating the Biot-Savart Law. You may want to refer to the first two homework assignments to refresh your memory of how we did electric field calculations.  We will also briefly review some of the numpy tools below.\n",

    "Note, I recommend checking the shape of the output of `np.apply_along_axis` before summing the individual B-field contributions of each current element (you can write a print statement inside the function definition as you test your code).  Note, we had 100 points sampling the line wire, so there are 100 quantized `dl` pieces.   After summing the contributions from all the `dl` elements, you will notice that there are additional axes (last two axes) contributing to the shape tuple.  The returned vector field should have the same shape as the input `field_points`.  The `field_points` have an (x, y, z) coordinate for every sampled point.  Similarly, the returned vector field should have a ($B_x, B_y, B_z$) for every sampled point in the meshgrid.\n",
